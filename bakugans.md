Bakugans are transforming spheres.
Once they hit a magnetic card the tiny sphere transforms into a small creature, like a dragon or griffin.
The way you play he game is by powering up your bakugans with ability cards, which raise the power points of your bakugan.
After you end your turn whoever has the highest power points wins!

My favorite Bakugan was Pyrus Draganoid, because that was the main character's bakugan in the show and it just looked the coolest.
