## Beyblades
Beyblades are spinning tops, usually based off of mythical creatures, like Pegasus and Phoenixes.

The way you play Beyblade is by you and an opponent using the launcher to spin up the beyblades and the toys clash against each other until one beyblade is left spinning. 

There are different types, such as attack types, defense types, and stamina types. My favorite types were the attack types, because they hit hard and knock the opponent out of the stadium.

Attached below is my favorite beyblade called Galaxy Pegasus.
