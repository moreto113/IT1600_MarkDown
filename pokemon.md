# Pokemon is a video game, however my favorite toys were the Pokemon toys that held a toy inside of it.

The toy would hold a soft plush Pokemon inside of it, and you would put the string attached to the pokeball around your finger. When you throw the pokeball, it would launch the soft plush out of the pokeball.

# My favorite Pokemons from those toys are
1. Chimchar
2. Starly
3. Pachirisu
